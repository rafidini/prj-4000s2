\brief detects minimal simple pairs in a 3D binary image

<B>Usage:</B> minimalsimplepair in.pgm [all] out.pgm

<B>Description:</B>
Detects minimal simple pairs in a 3D binary image. 
If the optional parameter \b all is used, then all 
minimal simple pairs are searched.
Otherwise, only one pair (if any) is given.

If the input image contains no simple point, consider using "simplepair" (faster)
instead of "minimalsimplepair".
