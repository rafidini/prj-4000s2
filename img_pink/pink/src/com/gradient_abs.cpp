   \brief Computes the absolute value of the gradient of the spline
   approximation of the image.
   
   <B>Usage:</B> gradient_abs( (float_image)image) -> float_image
   
   <B>Description:</B> The an image can be considered as a continuous
   field. This function approximates the image in all directions (x,
   y, z), with a 1D spline. Than it calculates the absolute value of
   the gradient for every point in form

   g[[x,y,z]] = fabs([ pd_x g, pd_y g, pd_z g ])

   here 'pd_x' stands for the partial derivative in the 'x' direction.

   <B>Types supported:</B> float 2d, float 3d
   
   <B>Category:</B> signal, development
   \ingroup signal, development
