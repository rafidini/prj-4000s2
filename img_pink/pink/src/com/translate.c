\brief image translation 

<B>Usage:</B> in.pgm ox oy oz [mode] out.ppm

<B>Description:</B>
Translates the image by the offsets \b ox, \b oy, \b oz in the directions
x, y, z respectively. Offsets may be negative or positive integers.
If \b mode is 0, the points that get out of the image frame are lost. 
If \b mode is 1, a torical space is simulated in all dimensions. 
Default mode is 0.

<B>Types supported:</B> byte 2d, byte3d

<B>Category:</B> geo
\ingroup  geo
