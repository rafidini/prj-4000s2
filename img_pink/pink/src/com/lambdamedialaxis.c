\brief discrete lambda-medial axis transform

<B>Usage:</B> lambdamedialaxis in.pgm [lambda] out.pgm

<B>Description:</B>
Discrete lambda-medial axis, as defined in [CCT09], 
of the binary image \b X contained in \b in.pgm.

By default, the output is a float image representing the function x->lambda(x).

If the parameter \b lambda is given (bash interface only, not python), the output is a binary image obtained by thresholding the aforementioned function at the value \b lambda .

<B>Types supported:</B> byte 2d, byte 3d
