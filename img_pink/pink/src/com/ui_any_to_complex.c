   \brief Creates a complex image from two images (one representing
   the real, and the other the imaginary part of the complex image)
   
   <B>Usage:</B> !!!!!!!
   
   <B>Description:</B> The two images can be of any type, but they need to be of the same time.

   <B>NOTE:</B> If you use complex images, than some information will
   be lost, as the resulting image will be float-complex anyway. Also
   if you use integers, some information may dissapear.
