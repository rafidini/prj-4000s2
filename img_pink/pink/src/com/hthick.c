\brief grayscale homotopic thickening

<B>Usage:</B> hthick in.pgm {imcond.pgm|null} connex niter out.pgm

<B>Description:</B>
Grayscale homotopic thickening (refs. [BEC97, CBB01]).
The parameter \b connex gives the connectivity used for the minima;
possible choices are 4, 8 in 2D and 6, 26 in 3D.
Let F be the function corresponding to the input image \b in.pgm.
Let G be the function corresponding to the input image 
\b imcond.pgm, or the blanck function (constant 255) if the keyword \b null is used.
The algorithm is the following:

\verbatim
Repeat niter times:
    L = {(p,d) such that p is constructible for F and d = delta+(p,F)}
    While L not empty
       extract a couple (p,d) from L
       F(p) = min{ d, delta+(p,F), G(p) }    
Result: F
\endverbatim

If \b niter is set to -1, then the operator iterates until stability.
