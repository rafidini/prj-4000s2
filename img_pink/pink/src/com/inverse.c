/*! \file inverse.c

\brief computes the pixelwise inverse of an image

<B>Usage:</B> inverse in.pgm [out.pgm]

<B>Description:</B>
Byte images: for each pixel x, out[x] = 255 - in[x].<br>
Long or float images: for each pixel x, out[x] = VMAX - in[x], where VMAX = max{in[x]}.

If \b out.pgm is not specified, then out.pgm = in.pgm.

<B>Types supported:</B> byte 2d, byte 3d, long 2d, long 3d, float 2d, float 3d

<B>Category:</B> arith
\ingroup  arith
