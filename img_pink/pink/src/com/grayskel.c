\brief grayscale homotopic skeleton

<B>Usage:</B> grayskel in.pgm {imcond.pgm|null} connex lambda out.pgm

<B>Description:</B>
Skeleton, either homotopic (<B>lambda</B> = 0) or non-homotopic, for 2D grayscale images
The skeleton is obtained by iterative lowering of lambda-destructible points
(see [CBB01]).
