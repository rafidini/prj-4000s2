Installation
***************************************

Method 1 (with cmake)
------------------------

Create a directory anywhere, but preferably outside of the main Pink directory. Let's call this new directory ${BUILD} (only an example) and ${PINK} the main Pink directory. Then do the following:

cd ${BUILD} 
cmake ${PINK}
make

this should work with default settings. If you want to peek at the settings, the procedure is

cd ${BUILD}
ccmake ${PINK}

then there is an interactive configuration screen. Type 'c' to configure the defaults ; 'c' again (that's the way it is), and then 'g' to generate the makefiles.
For the batch interface (default), the variable 'BASH_FRONT_END' should be 'ON'.
For the python interface, the variable 'PYTHON_FRONT_END' and the variable 'LIAR' should be both 'ON'.
IMPORTANT: do not select both bash and python interfaces at once, even if you want to install both. In this case, perform the installation twice.

then type 

make

The executables to be called from the bash (or csh, tcsh...) interface are located in directory '${BUILD}/bash'.

For launching the python interface, use the script '${BUILD}/pink.sh'.

Method 2 (without cmake)
------------------------

Linux

To install:

tar zxvf pink.tgz
mv Pinktmp <main_pink_directory>
cd <main_pink_directory>
./makelin

Executable files are in '<main_pink_directory>/linux/bin',
scripts are in '<main_pink_directory>/scripts',  '<main_pink_directory>/python', and in '<main_pink_directory>/tcl'
Update your $path variable accordingly.
For example (csh): 

setenv PINK <main_pink_directory>
set path=( $path $PINK/linux/bin $PINK/scripts $PINK/tcl  $PINK/scripts $PINK/python)

or (bash):

export PINK=<main_pink_directory>
export PATH=$PATH:$PINK/linux/bin:$PINK/scripts:$PINK/tcl:$PINK/scripts:$PINK/python

Windows

First, install <A HREF="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</A> (Minimalist GNU For Windows), 
and 'make' from the MinGW distribution (separate installation).

Uncompress the archive 'pink.tgz' (e.g. with WinZip or WinRar).

Depending on your configuration, update files 'mgw.make' and 'makemgw.bat'.

Launch a DOS terminal and go to the main pink directory.

then type: 

makemgw

Executable files are in '<main_pink_directory>\bin',
Update your PATH variable accordingly.

For example:

\verbatim
set PATH=<main_pink_directory>\bin;%PATH%
\endverbatim

The following software should also be installed:

<A HREF="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</A>
<A HREF="http://dev.scriptics.com/">ActiveTcl 8.3</A>
<A HREF="http://public.kitware.com/VTK/">VTK</A>
<A HREF="http://hugues.zahlt.info/Imview.html">ImView</A>
<A HREF="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html">MPlayer</A>
